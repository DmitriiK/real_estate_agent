Develop an AI-powered assistant for a real estate agency that assists potential buyers and renters in finding their ideal property. The assistant should engage users in a conversation, asking questions about their preferences such as location (city, neighborhood), budget range, property type (apartment, house, condo), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, desired amenities (parking, garden, pool), and proximity to schools or public transportation.
